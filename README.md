 Introduction:

This is a walkthrough of how I am exploring the dataset of flight delays, utalising my growing data science skills. I will be showcasing python coding engaging with libries such as pandas, matplotlib and seaborn. I will manipulate data to draw out trends producing graphs to better showcase these.

 Dataset:

 The dataset is about airline delay, with columns showcasing

 Insights:

Detailed below are explanations of trends and insights I discovered. 

Comparision between 2019 and 2020 insights:

Percent of total flights delayed

There is a clear difference between percent flights delay with 2019's average being 21% compared to 2020s 15% (a 6% increase) (shown in graph A)

Total Flights
    
I was curious how total flights changed between the two years and there was a 40.6% reduction (shown in graph B). This could be due to the pandemic as many flights were cancelled
