 Introduction:

This is a walkthrough of how I am exploring the dataset of flight delays, utalising my growing data science skills. I will be showcasing python coding engaging with libries such as pandas, matplotlib and seaborn. I will manipulate data to draw out trends producing graphs to better showcase these.

 Dataset:

 The dataset is about airline delay, with columns showcasing

 Insights:

Detailed below are explanations of trends and insights I discovered. 

Comparision between 2019 and 2020 insights:

Percent of total flights delayed

There is a clear difference between percent flights delay with 2019's average being 21% compared to 2020s 15% (a 6% decrease) (shown in graph A)

Total Flights
    
I was curious how total flights changed between the two years and there was a 40.6% reduction (shown in graph B). This could be due to the pandemic as many flights were cancelled. However you would expect 2020 and the pandemic to cause a greater portion of the flights to be cancelled.

Carrier Delay Analysis

I created a graph to explore how number of delays alter with different airlines. Graph C shows that some airlines have far more delays than others, for example South West Airlines with nearly 8000. I also split this by reason, finding that late_aircraft was the most common reason for these delays, again being nearly 4000 in total. I however concluded this could be due to some airlines taking in far more flights than others. For example southWest airlines takes in nearly 180,000 flights bewteen 2019 and 2020 when compared to Hawaiian Airlines Inc 10,000 flights could be explanation for this stark difference. Flight totals by carrier shown on graph E

Proportional Carrier Delay Analysis

To explore this I made a proportional Graph where I worked out the percent of total flights per carrier that are delayed (Graph D). This showed that SouthWest Airlines did not have the highest proportional delays and instead JetBlue and ExpressJet were with results of 25% and 23% respectivly. This is a better representation as it negates the number of intake flights. In example of SouthWest only 16% of total flights were delayed.
